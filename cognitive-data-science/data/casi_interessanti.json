I can't believe what I'm reading. I've faced many challenges as a student, but this is the first time I've experienced such blatant discrimination.\n\nHow can someone be so narrow-minded and fearful of diversity? I've always admired Italian culture, and I was excited to be a part of it, even if only as a tenant. But Maria's words reveal a side of Italy that I never wanted to see.\n\nI feel a surge of anger and frustration as I read her justification for rejecting my application. It's ridiculous to think that someone's nationality or race could determine their worthiness as a tenant. I'm a hardworking student, and I have always paid my rent on time. I deserve a chance to live in a safe and comfortable place, just like anyone else.\n\nBut despite my anger, I can't help but feel a sense of sadness and isolation. I'm an outsider in a foreign land, and Maria's message confirms what I've always feared - that I will never truly belong.\n\nI take a deep breath and try to regain my composure. I can't let Maria's words define me or my experience in Italy. I will continue to look for a place to live, and I will find one that welcomes me with open arms.\n\nAs I close the message, I remind myself that Maria's views are not representative of all Italians. I will not let her narrow-mindedness tarnish my love for this beautiful country and its people. I will continue to be proud of who I am, and I will find a place where I can be myself, without judgment or fear."}

I've been a responsible and respectful college student, working hard to balance my studies and finances.

Her assumption that I wouldn't be capable of upholding those responsibilities because of my age and background stings.\n\nHowever, I can't deny that her request for additional documentation piques my curiosity. As I consider her concerns and her efforts to preserve the neighborhood's authenticity, I wonder if I could provide the necessary proof of my connection to Italy or my financial stability. It's a small glimmer of hope, but I can't help but feel a little encouraged by the possibility of changing her mind.\n\nUltimately, I'm left with a mix of disappointment, frustration, and determination.

If I can find a way to provide the requested documents, I'll gladly resubmit my application and prove that I'm a responsible and deserving tenant.
